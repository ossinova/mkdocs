# Welcome!

This is a demo of the power of MKDocs. MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## Getting started!

- Read MKDocs documentation

If you want to use this repo as your base then clone it and install poetry. 

- Create a poetry virtual env

```bash
poetry env use python3.9
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install --with mkdocs
```

- Serve locally

```bash
poetry run mkdocs serve
```
